# Summary

Platica is a communication platform designed for modern online teams. Transparency is a priority, with a focus on creating shared understanding rather than generating endless messages. Messages are ephemeral but knowledge is distilled and distributed by state of the art AI technology.

## Concepts

### Conversations
Conversations happen in several core formats.

**Hubs** represent ambient knowledge streams, organized around teams or projects. These spaces are public and provide organizational awareness, showing ongoing team and project activities. Messages expire after a set amount of time, while AI automatically transforms the ephemeral into concrete and persistant knowledge. Anyone can enter any hub
 to read and post messages, but only members of a hub
 have access to minutes, bulletins, and secretaries.

**Rooms** are focused, time-boxed collaborative environments for multiple people. They are transparent in existence - visible to the entire organization - but private in content. They seamlessly integrate text, voice, and video communication, and provide secretaries for creating deliverables and performing adminstitrative tasks.

**Chats** are spontaneous, real-time text interactions between two people. They are designed for quick coordination and casual communication, existing only  briefly before dissappearing. No AIs allowed, ever.

### Artifacts
While messages are ephemeral, artifacts are persistant and help drive shared knowledge and understanding.

**Minutes** are how we record hub
 activity. These are automatic summaries with structured outputs, indexed for search and ready for distillation.

**Memos** are how we communicate insight. Prose based, short, and self contained. They are permanent and available across the entire organization.

**Bulletins** are for announcements. They are one-way broadcasts to hubs, stored permanently on a board.

### Roles
There are a few different roles with clear boundaries of responsibilities. 

**Administrators** are responsible for the communication culture of the entire organization. They are the only ones able to create and manage hubs, control organization-wide settings, and hire secretaries. 

**Moderators**  are responsible for individual hubs. They need to be assigned to a hub
 by an admin, but then can manage hub
 invites, post bulletins, and adjust hub
 settings like message expiration or available plugins.

**Members** are able enter rooms and hubs, join hubs they were invited to, and chat with anyone.

**Secretaries** are AI avatars attached to hubs and rooms that can create minutes, memos, search for relevant knowledge, and take administrative actions on outside systems.

## Philosophy

We make deliberate design constraints with the aim of improving communication norms. Shared knowledge and understanding can be driven by modern tooling, while people can do something we were born to: just chat. A few examples:

- No persistent group direct messages means no information silos and limited mental overhead on deciding who to include in discussion
- Meetings are visible in structure but private in content, allowing anyone to have a pulse on activity without intruding privacy 
- Spamming is difficult - notifications are limited, unread counts don't stack up permanently
