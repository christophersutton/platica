## Questions/Notes
- What are the default/maximum time limits for rooms?
- Can rooms be extended while active?
- Should we support scheduled rooms for future start?
- How do we handle room archival/cleanup?
- Do we need member roles within rooms?
- Should there be a limit on concurrent room membership?
- How should we handle room discovery/privacy?
- What happens to a room if creator leaves?

## Decisions
- Persistence: [2025-01-10] Unlike chats, room messages will be stored until room closure
- Visibility: [2025-01-10] Room existence and metadata public, contents private
- Membership: [2025-01-10] Users can only be in one room at a time
- State Management: [2025-01-10] Will use similar patterns to channels for consistency
