4. Provider Integration
   - Update provider hierarchy
   - Add error boundaries
   - Test state isolation
   - Verify performance

## Objective
Refactor the frontend state management to use domain-driven contexts with proper separation between global and domain-specific state.

## Current Issues
1. Monolithic AppContext handling too many concerns
2. Typing/presence mixed between global and domain state
3. No clear separation between domains
4. All state changes go through a single reducer
5. Potential performance issues with large state updates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Global Presence âœ…
Tasks:
1. Create PresenceContext
   - [x] Basic online/offline tracking
   - [x] Last seen timestamps
   - [x] Room status tracking
   - [x] Custom status support

2. WebSocket Integration
   - [x] Handle presence events
   - [x] Add presence broadcasts
   - [x] Add connection recovery
   - [x] Add proper cleanup

### Phase 2: Channel Context
Tasks:
1. Move Typing State
   - [x] Add typing to channel state
   - [x] Update typing handlers
   - [x] Add proper cleanup
   - [x] Test performance

2. Add Channel Presence
   - [ ] Track active users
   - [ ] Track viewing users
   - [ ] Handle presence updates
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup

### Phase 3: Room Context
Tasks:
1. Basic Structure
   - [ ] Create context and reducer
   - [ ] Add normalized state
   - [ ] Add room operations
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup

2. Room-Specific Features
   - [ ] Add room presence
   - [ ] Add room typing
   - [ ] Handle room events
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup

### Phase 4: Chat Context
Tasks:
1. Basic Structure
   - [ ] Create context and reducer
   - [ ] Add normalized state
   - [ ] Add chat operations
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup

2. Chat-Specific Features
   - [ ] Add chat presence
   - [ ] Add chat typing
   - [ ] Handle chat events
   - [ ] Add proper cleanup

### Phase 5: Integration
Tasks:
1. Provider Structure
   - [ ] Set up provider hierarchy
   - [ ] Add error boundaries
   - [ ] Configure React Query

2. Component Updates
   - [ ] Migrate from AppContext
   - [ ] Update component props
   - [ ] Add loading states

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
Tasks:
