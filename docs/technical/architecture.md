## Data Model Evolution

Data models are the foundation of our system and changes have wide-ranging impacts. All model changes must:

1. Be reviewed independently
   - Create separate proposals for model changes
   - Review in isolation from feature work
   - Consider all affected components

2. Include all affected layers
   - Database schema and migrations
   - API contracts and versioning
   - Frontend state management
   - WebSocket events
   - Type definitions

3. Consider backward compatibility
   - Impact on existing data
   - API versioning needs
   - Client compatibility
   - Migration complexity

4. Document migration paths
   - Database schema changes
   - Data transformation needs
   - Client update requirements
   - Deployment ordering

5. Require explicit approval
   - No bundling with feature work
   - Clear documentation of changes
   - Impact assessment
   - Migration plan

### Process for Model Changes

1. Identify need for model change
2. Create proposal document
3. Review all impacted areas
4. Plan migration strategy
5. Get explicit approval
6. Implement changes
7. Update documentation

### Common Pitfalls

- Mixing model changes with feature work
- Missing implicit dependencies
- Incomplete impact assessment
- Insufficient migration planning
- Poor documentation of changes

### Best Practices

- Keep changes small and focused
- Consider all data layers
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Document everything
- Test migration paths
- Get early feedback
